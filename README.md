# zizmor

A tool for finding security issues in GitHub Actions CI/CD setups.

At the moment, `zizmor` only supports workflow definitions, and only
detects a small subset of known issues. See the [roadmap]
for details on our plans.

## Usage

```bash
cargo build
./target/debug/zizmor --help
```

## The name?
